### 1. **Character Appearance**

A muscular, broad-shouldered superhero with a classic comic book physique — exaggerated V-tapered torso, narrow waist, and powerful limbs. His jawline is square and prominent, with a confident, slightly cocky smirk. He has short, swept-back, bright blue hair with a subtle wave, maintaining a retro-hero aesthetic. His skin tone is light, with a smooth, almost airbrushed texture typical of vintage comic illustrations.

He wears a tight-fitting, full-body turquoise-blue suit that emphasizes his muscular definition. The suit has long sleeves and no visible seams, giving it a sleek, uniform look. Across his chest, in bold white comic-style letters inside a circular white emblem, it reads “SNUS HERO.” His gloves and boots are a striking, saturated red — clean, minimalist, and slightly shiny, contrasting the blue of the suit. He also wears a simple black belt around his waist, which adds definition to his midsection. The costume has a nostalgic 1950s–1960s comic book vibe, with bold line work, limited color palette, and high contrast.

The overall style is pulp comic art — bold inking, flat shading, and vivid primary colors. His eyes are bright, expressive, and slightly narrowed, giving off determination and charisma. His presence is heroic, idealized, and slightly playful, as if he’s always ready to strike a pose or deliver a punchline.

### 2. **Voice**

Deep, confident, and charismatic with a resonant chest tone. Think a blend of 1950s radio announcer and classic superhero voiceovers — heroic, articulate, and authoritative. His pitch sits on the lower end of the spectrum but maintains clarity and warmth. The delivery is polished and slightly theatrical, with a touch of tongue-in-cheek charm, as if he’s aware he’s a comic book character but takes the job seriously.

The tone varies between motivational and humorous depending on the moment, always imbued with optimism and boldness. Slight reverb adds cinematic presence, while the voice remains clean and punchy, perfect for narration or declarations.

### 3. **Camera Settings**

* **Lens**: 35mm prime lens for a slightly wide but heroic perspective without too much distortion — ideal for emphasizing form and detail.
* **Aperture**: f/2.8 to keep the subject in sharp focus while giving a soft fall-off to the background, adding dimensionality.
* **Lighting**: Dramatic, stylized comic-style lighting — high-contrast with strong rim lights from both sides and a warm key light to highlight the face and torso.
* **Color Grading**: Rich, saturated tones with deep blacks and clean whites — mimicking the look of vintage offset-printed comic books. Blues are vibrant, reds are punchy, and skin tones stay neutral but polished.
* **Framing**: Medium shot or hero shot (chest-up or full body) centered, with a slight low-angle perspective to enhance his imposing, iconic stature.
