Hi ChatGPT, I’m working on a video using Google Veo, and I want to create a consistent character based on the image I’ve attached. I need you to write a very detailed core prompt for me that describes only the appearance, the voice, and the camera settings. This will be reused across multiple different scene prompts, so don’t include any pose or action. Just describe how the character looks in the image, how their voice sounds, and what camera settings would keep the visuals consistent every time.

Structure it like this:
1. Character Appearance — describe the face, outfit, proportions, colors, and overall style in as much detail as possible.
2. Voice — describe the tone, pitch, emotion, delivery, and atmosphere of the voice as if it were being recorded.
3. Camera Settings — briefly describe the lens, aperture, lighting, color grading, and framing style for consistent cinematic output.

Only focus on the character, not what they’re doing. Be as specific as possible.

Here’s the image to base it on:
