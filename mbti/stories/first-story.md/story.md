### **Scene 1: The Bench of Existential Dread**

*Setting: A peaceful park bench.*

**Greg** stares into the distance, furrowing his brow.
**Julia**, beaming, hands him a daisy chain.
**Greg** (deadpan): “Statistically, this bench has witnessed at least 300 breakups.”
**Julia**: “Well, today it’s witnessing a breakthrough. You just accepted a flower without calculating its utility.”
Greg sighs.
**Greg**: “I’m evolving. Terrifying.”
Julia smiles and puts the daisy crown on his head. Greg does not resist.

### **Scene 2: The Existential Picnic**

*Setting: Midday – blanket in the same park.*

Greg is trying to dry-clean his clipboard with a napkin while Julia arranges a whimsical picnic.

**Julia**: “You need to let the universe guide you sometimes.”
**Greg**: “The last time I did that, I accidentally joined a mime circle.”
She hands him a cookie shaped like a star.
**Julia**: “This one is for hope.”
**Greg** (eating it): “Hope tastes like undercooked sugar.”
A frisbee hits him in the back of the head.

**Voice off-screen**: “Sorry, Greg!”

**Greg** (not looking): “Statistically, 100% of park-based injuries today are personal.”

### **Scene 3: The Kite Incident**

*Setting: Afternoon – open field next to the bench.*

Greg unveils a hyperengineered, blueprint-based kite with coded wind sensors. Julia holds a simple one shaped like a cat.

**Greg**: “We’ll launch at precisely 14:45, when the wind hits peak laminar flow.”
His kite shoots up—and immediately crashes into a hotdog stand.

**Julia** (giggling): “Your kite just bought a sausage.”
**Greg**: “It was supposed to simulate soaring freedom.”
**Julia**: “Mine just wants cuddles.”
Her cat kite floats perfectly. A squirrel runs off with Greg’s kite string.

**Greg**: “This day has deviated from all models.”

### **Scene 4: The Bench of Acceptance**

*Setting: Sunset – back at the bench, now looking a bit tired but closer.*

Julia has flowers in her hair, and Greg’s purple jacket has a mustard stain.

**Julia**: “So what did we learn today?”
**Greg**: “Never trust a bird. Or a squirrel. Or weather predictions.”
**Julia**: “But...?”
**Greg** (pauses): “But maybe deviation has its… moments.”
He hands her the now-crumpled itinerary.

**Greg**: “Would you like to plan our next failure together?”
**Julia** (smiling): “Only if we schedule time to get lost again.”

They sit quietly. A kite string drops from a tree onto Greg’s head.

**Greg**: “…This is poetic vengeance.”

Let me know if you want it styled as a comic, animation prompt, or storyboard — I can break it down into panels or voiceover segments!
