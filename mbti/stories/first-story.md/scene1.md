### Voice

**Greg**:

The character's voice is warm, mid-to-low in pitch, with a slightly gravelly texture that suggests age and experience, but not frailty. His tone is thoughtful and deliberate, with a calm cadence, often pausing mid-sentence as if deep in analysis. He speaks with a hint of an Eastern European accent, lightly inflected rather than caricatured. There's a contemplative atmosphere in his delivery, like a seasoned strategist quietly narrating his thoughts. The voice recording should feel close and intimate, with subtle room tone and minimal reverb, capturing the clarity and richness of every word.

**Julia**:

The character's voice is light, clear, and melodic, with a soft, bell-like quality that evokes a sense of wonder and playfulness. Her pitch is gently high—feminine but not exaggerated—sitting comfortably in the upper-mid vocal range, with occasional lilting rises at the end of her sentences that give her speech a whimsical, inquisitive tone. She speaks with a warm, nurturing energy, as if every word is meant to brighten or soothe. Each phrase is delivered with gentle precision, her pace slow and deliberate, as though she’s savoring the meaning behind her words. There’s a natural musicality to her cadence, with subtle pauses that create space for reflection or awe. Her voice carries the emotion of someone who sees beauty in small things—hopeful, serene, and slightly enchanted. If any accent is present, it’s soft and ambiguous, leaning toward a lyrical Nordic or Elvish influence, but not enough to distract from clarity. The recording atmosphere should feel organic and close, with a soft natural ambience and minimal reverb—just enough to preserve the intimacy and airiness of her tone.

Scene Description: 

**Greg** stares into the distance, furrowing his brow.
**Julia**, beaming, hands him a daisy chain.
**Greg** (deadpan): “Statistically, this bench has witnessed at least 300 breakups.”
**Julia**: “Well, today it’s witnessing a breakthrough. You just accepted a flower without calculating its utility.”
Greg sighs.
**Greg**: “I’m evolving. Terrifying.”
Julia smiles and puts the daisy crown on his head. Greg does not resist.
