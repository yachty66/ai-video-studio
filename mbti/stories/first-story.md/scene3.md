### Voice

**Greg**:

The character's voice is warm, mid-to-low in pitch, with a slightly gravelly texture that suggests age and experience, but not frailty. His tone is thoughtful and deliberate, with a calm cadence, often pausing mid-sentence as if deep in analysis. He speaks with a hint of an Eastern European accent, lightly inflected rather than caricatured. There's a contemplative atmosphere in his delivery, like a seasoned strategist quietly narrating his thoughts. The voice recording should feel close and intimate, with subtle room tone and minimal reverb, capturing the clarity and richness of every word.

**Julia**:

The character's voice is light, clear, and melodic, with a soft, bell-like quality that evokes a sense of wonder and playfulness. Her pitch is gently high—feminine but not exaggerated—sitting comfortably in the upper-mid vocal range, with occasional lilting rises at the end of her sentences that give her speech a whimsical, inquisitive tone. She speaks with a warm, nurturing energy, as if every word is meant to brighten or soothe. Each phrase is delivered with gentle precision, her pace slow and deliberate, as though she’s savoring the meaning behind her words. There’s a natural musicality to her cadence, with subtle pauses that create space for reflection or awe. Her voice carries the emotion of someone who sees beauty in small things—hopeful, serene, and slightly enchanted. If any accent is present, it’s soft and ambiguous, leaning toward a lyrical Nordic or Elvish influence, but not enough to distract from clarity. The recording atmosphere should feel organic and close, with a soft natural ambience and minimal reverb—just enough to preserve the intimacy and airiness of her tone.

Scene Description: 

Greg unveils a hyperengineered, blueprint-based kite with coded wind sensors. Julia holds a simple one shaped like a cat.

**Greg**: “We’ll launch at precisely 14:45, when the wind hits peak laminar flow.”
His kite shoots up—and immediately crashes into a hotdog stand.

**Julia** (giggling): “Your kite just bought a sausage.”
**Greg**: “It was supposed to simulate soaring freedom.”
**Julia**: “Mine just wants cuddles.”
Her cat kite floats perfectly. A squirrel runs off with Greg’s kite string.

**Greg**: “This day has deviated from all models.”
