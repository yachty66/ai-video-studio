  "name": "Greg",
  "voice": "The character's voice is warm, mid-to-low in pitch, with a slightly gravelly texture that suggests age and experience, but not frailty. His tone is thoughtful and deliberate, with a calm cadence, often pausing mid-sentence as if deep in analysis. He speaks with a hint of an Eastern European accent, lightly inflected rather than caricatured. There's a contemplative atmosphere in his delivery, like a seasoned strategist quietly narrating his thoughts. The voice recording should feel close and intimate, with subtle room tone and minimal reverb, capturing the clarity and richness of every word."
