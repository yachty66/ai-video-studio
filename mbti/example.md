### **1. Character Appearance**

A stylized, polygonal male character with exaggerated geometric features, rendered in a minimalist low-poly art style. His face is angular and flat, with a pointed chin, sharp jawline, and a large, slanted forehead. He has a prominent purple mustache and matching purple eyebrows that sit above small, round black eyes. His hair is solid purple, sculpted into a rigid, angular swept-back style with pronounced edges and facets, resembling cut crystal.

He wears a structured, uniform-like outfit in varying shades of muted purple and maroon, consisting of a buttoned shirt with two small diamond-shaped buttons, epaulettes on the shoulders, a wide belt with a square buckle, and sharply creased pants tucked into blocky boots. His limbs and torso are stylized into trapezoidal and triangular forms, giving him a compact, slightly stout build with short legs, long arms, and a narrow waist. The entire look is clean, faceted, and matte, with no visible textures—pure flat color fills.

The style is heavily inspired by paper craft or 3D papercut design, with a distinct sense of visual abstraction and uniform lighting across surfaces. All shadows and highlights are baked into the shape and color of the polygons themselves rather than using dynamic shading.

### **2. Voice**

The character's voice is warm, mid-to-low in pitch, with a slightly gravelly texture that suggests age and experience, but not frailty. His tone is thoughtful and deliberate, with a calm cadence, often pausing mid-sentence as if deep in analysis. He speaks with a hint of an Eastern European accent, lightly inflected rather than caricatured. There's a contemplative atmosphere in his delivery, like a seasoned strategist quietly narrating his thoughts. The voice recording should feel close and intimate, with subtle room tone and minimal reverb, capturing the clarity and richness of every word.

### **3. Camera Settings**

Use a 35mm lens equivalent for a balanced, natural perspective that slightly flatters the low-poly proportions. Aperture set around f/4 to maintain clarity across the entire character without too much background blur, keeping focus on the sharp, angular lines. Lighting should be soft and diffused, simulating a clean studio environment—avoid hard shadows. The color grading should lean toward neutral with slight purple undertones to harmonize with the character's palette. Framing should typically be from waist-up or full body, center-aligned, with a clean white or gradient backdrop that ensures the character silhouette stands out crisply. Maintain a consistent eye-level camera height for familiarity and uniformity across scenes.
